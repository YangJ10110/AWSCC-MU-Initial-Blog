## Beyond Code: Fostering Real-World Software Practices
Instead of focusing solely on coding, AWS Cloud Club Mapúa (AWSCC MU) structured its website project as a **community-driven initiative**. This approach immersed students in **version control, project management, and ticketing**, essential skills in modern software development. By prioritizing structured workflows over ad-hoc coding, members gained hands-on experience with **Git, pull requests, and collaborative issue tracking**, bridging the gap between academic learning and professional software engineering.

## Self-Learning and Collaboration Over Competition
This initiative encouraged students to **go beyond the curriculum**, exploring tools and practices used in industry. Members learned how to:
- Set up development environments and repositories
- Document their work for open-source collaboration
- Debug and troubleshoot real-world issues independently

By fostering **pair programming, code reviews, and mentorship**, we built an environment where students supported one another, strengthening teamwork and shared learning. This culture shift transformed software development into a **collaborative experience rather than an individual pursuit**.

## The Future: A Stronger, More Connected Tech Community
Through this project, AWSCC MU proved that impactful learning happens when students **build together**. Moving forward, we aim to:
- **Expand mentorship programs** to guide new contributors
- **Introduce structured learning paths** for various skill levels
- **Continue open-source collaborations** that encourage real-world application

This initiative was more than just building a website—it was about **creating a culture of innovation, teamwork, and continuous learning** that will shape the next generation of software engineers.
